1. Create and initialize end_result variable to zero
2. Ask INPUT from user and store it in variable "n"
3. IF n is equal to zero 
	PRINT end_result 
	Stop the program
4 ELSE IF 'n' is not equal to zero
	IF Conversion Error to INTEGER 
		PRINT the error and ask for INPUT again
	ELSE IF no Conversion Error
		Square 'n' 
		Add 'n' to end_result
		return to step 2
